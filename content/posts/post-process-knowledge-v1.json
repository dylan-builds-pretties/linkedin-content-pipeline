  "content": "Most teams think their process is their workflow.\n\nIt's not.\n\nYour process is whatever actually happens when work gets done.\n\nAnd here's what nobody tells you:\n\nIf you can't explain it to a system, you don't actually understand it.\n\nYou just know that certain people make it work.\n\n→ The person who \"just knows\" which deals to pursue\n→ The person who \"has a feel\" for what will close\n→ The person who \"remembers\" how to handle edge cases\n\nThis isn't a process.\n\nIt's tribal knowledge.\n\nAnd tribal knowledge has a half-life.\n\nWhen that person leaves, gets busy, or changes roles, the process breaks.\n\nFast teams are doing something different:\n\nThey're extracting the \"why\" behind the \"what.\"\n\nNot just \"We filter by price.\"\n\nBut \"We filter by price because X, Y, and Z—and here's when we make exceptions.\"\n\nWhen you can articulate the logic, you can:\n\n→ Automate the repetitive parts\n→ Scale the judgment parts\n→ Preserve the institutional knowledge\n\nThe teams winning right now aren't the ones with the best tools.\n\nThey're the ones who understand their own operations well enough to know what to keep, what to automate, and what to eliminate.\n\nWhat's one process in your workflow that only \"works\" because of one person?",
