  "content": "Last month, we launched a feature nobody wanted.\n\nWe spent 6 weeks building it. The team was excited. We wrote the perfect announcement post.\n\n12 likes. 2 comments (one was my mom).\n\nHere's what I learned:\n\nWe built what WE thought was cool instead of what our users actually needed.\n\nThe irony? When I posted about the failure - raw, unfiltered, embarrassed - it got 10x the engagement.\n\nPeople don't connect with your wins.\nThey connect with your humanity.\n\nNow we do customer calls before writing a single line of code.\n\nWhat's a \"failure\" that taught you more than any success?",
