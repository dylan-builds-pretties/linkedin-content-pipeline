  Last month, we launched a feature nobody wanted.

  We spent 6 weeks building it. The team was excited.
  We wrote the perfect announcement post.

  12 likes. 2 comments (one was my mom).

  Here's what I learned:

  We built what WE thought was cool instead of what our users actually needed.

  The irony? When I posted about the failure - raw, unfiltered,
  embarrassed - it got 10x the engagement.

  People don't connect with your wins.
  They connect with your humanity.

  Now we do customer calls before writing a single line of code.

  What's a "failure" that taught you more than any success?
