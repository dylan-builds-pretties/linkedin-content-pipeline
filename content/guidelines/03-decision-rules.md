# Decision Rules

**What Ships vs What Gets Killed**

Elite teams use filters, not opinions. Your team should literally check these before posting.

## The 3-Question Content Gate

Every post must pass ALL of these questions. If any answer is "no," the content does not ship.

### 1. Would this still be useful if Pillar didn't exist?

**Why it matters:** Content should provide standalone value. If it only makes sense as Pillar marketing, it's not content. It's an ad.

- **If YES** → Proceed
- **If NO** → Kill it

### 2. Is this specific enough to feel lived-in?

**Why it matters:** Vague observations feel like content marketing. Specific details feel like experience. The difference is trust.

- **If YES** → Proceed
- **If NO** → Add concrete detail or kill it

### 3. Would we still post this with comments disabled?

**Why it matters:** If you're only posting to get engagement, it's engagement bait. Real content stands on its own.

- **If YES** → Proceed
- **If NO** → It's engagement bait. Kill it.

## Quick Kill Signals

Immediately kill or revise if you see any of these:

- Exclamation points
- "Revolutionize," "unlock," "supercharge," "game-changing"
- Questions designed to bait comments
- Vague claims without specifics
- Feature announcements disguised as insights
- "We're excited to announce..."
- Anything that sounds like it came from a marketing deck

---

## Quick Ship Signals

Strong indicators the content is on-brand:

- Reads like a private note to a peer
- Makes a claim you could defend in a room of skeptics
- Contains a specific number, example, or observation
- Could be quoted back to you in a year
- Teaches something the reader didn't know
- Takes a position

## The Review Checklist

Before any post ships, someone must answer:

| Question | Answer Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| Which pillar is this? | [Education / Observations / Behind-the-Scenes / Memes] |
| What specific insight is delivered? | [One sentence] |
| What sentence would you cut if forced? | [Identify the weakest line] |

If you can't answer all three, the post isn't ready.
