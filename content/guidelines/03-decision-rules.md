**What Ships vs What Gets Killed**

---

## The 3-Question Content Gate

Every post must pass ALL of these questions. If any answer is "no," the content does not ship.

### 1. Would this still be useful if Pillar didn't exist?

**Why it matters:** Content should provide standalone value. If it only makes sense as Pillar marketing, it's not content. It's an ad.

- **If YES** → Proceed
- **If NO** → Kill it

### 2. Is this specific enough to feel lived-in?

**Why it matters:** Vague observations feel like content marketing. Specific details feel like experience. The difference is trust.

- **If YES** → Proceed
- **If NO** → Add concrete detail or kill it

### 3. Would we still post this with comments disabled?

**Why it matters:** If you're only posting to get engagement, it's engagement bait. Real content stands on its own.

- **If YES** → Proceed
- **If NO** → It's engagement bait. Kill it.

## Quick Ship Signals

Strong indicators the content is on-brand:

- Reads like a private note to a peer
- Makes a claim you could defend in a room of skeptics
- Contains a specific number, example, or observation
- Could be quoted back to you in a year
- Teaches something the reader didn't know
- Takes a position
