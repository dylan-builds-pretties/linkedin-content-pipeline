# Pillar's Social Media Operating System

**The Elite Social Media Operating System for Pillar**

Top-tier software brands treat social media as a production system, not a posting habit. This documentation covers the four layers of that system:

1. [Brand Voice](./01-brand-voice.md) - Voice, values, worldview
2. [Content Pillars](./02-content-pillars.md) - Pillars + formats
3. [Decision Rules](./03-decision-rules.md) - What to post, what not to
4. [Cadence System](./04-cadence-system.md) - Time horizons + flywheel
5. [Post Formats](./06-post-formats.md) - Format menu for content

## Quick Reference: Voice Polarity

| Pillar IS | Pillar IS NOT |
|-----------|---------------|
| Calm | Salesy |
| Observational | Cheerleader-y |
| Slightly contrarian | VC buzzword-heavy |
| Systems-oriented | "AI will change everything" vague |
| Operator-to-operator | Broker-centric |
| Precise with language | Motivational quote content |

Posts should feel like they were written by someone who builds tools, not someone who markets tools.

## Quick Reference: Content Pillar Matrix

| Pillar | Core Belief | Allowed Formats | Hard No's |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Systems Thinking | Structure beats hustle | Text posts, diagrams, before/after | Motivation quotes |
| Data Literacy | Data ≠ insight | Explanations, warnings, observations | Buzzwords |
| Behind-the-Scenes | We build what we wish existed | Engineering insights, lessons learned | Marketing speak |
| Market Reality Checks | Deals fail for boring reasons | Post-mortems, pattern recognition | Hype |
| Quiet Wins | Results > launches | Adoption patterns, customer insights | Bragging |

## Quick Reference: 5-Question Content Gate

Before posting, the content must pass ALL of these:

1. **Would this still be useful if Pillar didn't exist?** → If no, kill it
2. **Does this teach a way of thinking, not just a feature?** → If no, rewrite
3. **Could a smart operator disagree, but respect it?** → If no, too safe
4. **Is this specific enough to feel lived-in?** → If no, add detail or kill
5. **Would we still post this with comments disabled?** → If no, it's engagement bait

## Quick Reference: Time Horizons

| Cadence | Purpose | Audience State |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Daily | Stay present | "I recognize this name" |
| Weekly | Build trust | "These people think clearly" |
| Monthly | Establish authority | "They see the future early" |
| Quarterly | Define the category | "They shape how I think" |
| Annual | Set the narrative | "They're leading the space" |

## Core Worldview

Every post must align with at least one of these beliefs:

- Land is not scarce. Insight is.
- Speed comes from systems, not hustle.
- Judgment is valuable only when it's repeatable.
- Real estate teams don't lack data. They lack structure.
- The best operators think in workflows, not deals.

**If a post does not reinforce one of these beliefs, it does not ship.**

## Content North Star

> If Pillar disappeared tomorrow, people should still say:
>
> **"They helped me understand how modern real estate teams actually work."**

That's the bar.
