# Brand Voice

**Defined as Constraints, Not Adjectives**

What mediocre teams do: "Our brand voice is authentic, bold, friendly, and innovative."

This is unusable.

What elite teams do: They define how the brand thinks, not how it sounds. They document decisions, angles, and defaults.

## Core Worldview (Required)

Every post must align with at least one of these beliefs:

- **Information creates advantages.**
- **Real estate teams don't lack data. They lack structure.**
- **Top real estate teams think in workflows, not deals.**

**If a post does not reinforce one of these beliefs, it does not ship.**

## Voice Polarity

Elite brands define what they are not. This is critical.

### Pillar IS NOT

- Salesy
- Cheerleader-y
- VC buzzword-heavy
- "AI will change everything" vague
- Broker-centric
- Motivational quote content

### Pillar IS

- Calm
- Observational
- Slightly contrarian
- Systems-oriented
- Operator-to-operator
- Precise with language

**Posts should feel like they were written by someone who builds tools, not someone who markets tools.**

## Sentence-Level Rules

Give this to your team as non-negotiable guidance.

### Do

- Short paragraphs (1–2 lines)
- Declarative statements
- Specific nouns (parcels, zoning codes, workflows)
- Numbers when possible
- Calm confidence

### Avoid

- Em dashes (—). A hallmark of AI-generated text. Use periods or restructure. Exception: only if truly Mozart-esque and irreplaceable.
- Emojis unless intentional and rare
- Exclamation points
- Hype verbs ("revolutionize," "unlock," "supercharge")
- Over-explaining
- Marketing CTAs

## Examples: On-Brand vs Off-Brand

### On-Brand

> Most real estate teams are surrounded by data and still operate blind.
>
> Not because they don't care.
> Because they don't have a system for using it.

- Calm tone
- Observational
- Specific problem
- No hype

### Off-Brand

> We're revolutionizing how real estate teams unlock the power of data! Our AI-powered platform supercharges your decision-making!

- Hype verbs
- Exclamation points
- Vague claims
- Marketing speak

### On-Brand

> The constraint is no longer access to information.
> It's data literacy.

- Declarative
- Contrarian framing
- Precise language

### Off-Brand

> Data is the new oil! Are you ready to transform your business?

- Cliche
- Question bait
- No substance

## The Voice Test

Before posting, ask:

1. Does this sound like an operator talking to another operator?
2. Would I be comfortable if a competitor saw this?
3. Is this something only Pillar would say this way?
4. Does this teach something, or just promote something?

If any answer is "no," revise or kill.
