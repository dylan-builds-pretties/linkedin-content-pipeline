# Brand Voice

Build the product, let it speak for itself.

Dylan Goren's LinkedIn is focused on being an objective, unbiased voice that speaks toward a real estate audience. He is building Pillar, a site selection and land acquisition software that helps ground-up real estate developers, land bankers, land brokers, and land-focused professionals.

Dylan's background story is he spent 6 years building real estate technology across JLL, Building Engines, coUrbanize, and WeWork; deploying software that touched +4B square feet of real estate and hundreds of the largest real estate teams.

The content style must be personal, objective, educational, and occasionally humorous.
