  Voice note from morning walk:

  Thinking about how we've been building in public for 6 months now...
  the transparency has been scary but also freeing. People actually
  respond to the messy parts more than the polished announcements.

  That time I shared our failed product launch got 10x the engagement
  of any success post.

  Maybe there's something here about vulnerability in leadership?
  Or authenticity vs. performance?

  Also random idea - what if we did a behind the scenes series
  showing actual slack conversations?
