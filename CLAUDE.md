# Claude Code Prompts

Copy-paste these prompts when working with Claude Code in this repo.

## Generate Themes from Braindumps

```
Read all the braindump files in content/01-braindumps/ and identify
common themes. For each theme, create a new file in content/02-themes/
with:
- A clear theme title
- Key points (3-5 bullets)
- Which braindumps contributed to this theme
- 2-3 potential post angles

Name files descriptively, e.g., "founder-authenticity.md"
```

---

## Generate LinkedIn Drafts from a Theme

```
Read the theme file content/02-themes/[THEME-NAME].md and write
2-3 LinkedIn post drafts in content/03-drafts/.

Guidelines:
- Keep posts under 1300 characters (LinkedIn limit for full display)
- Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Start with a hook that stops the scroll
- End with a question or call to action
- Be conversational, not corporate
- Include line breaks for readability

Name files: YYYY-MM-DD-topic-v1.md, v2.md, etc.
```

## Show Pipeline Status

```
Give me a quick summary of the content pipeline:
- How many braindumps in content/01-braindumps/?
- How many themes in content/02-themes/?
- How many drafts in content/03-drafts/?
- What's scheduled in content/04-scheduled/?

List the files in each folder with their dates.
```

---

## Review a Draft

```
Read the draft at content/03-drafts/[FILENAME].md and give me feedback:
- Is the hook strong enough?
- Is it too long or too short?
- Does it sound authentic or corporate?
- Any suggested edits?
```

---

## Combine Multiple Braindumps

```
Read all braindumps from this week (or specify dates) and create
a single consolidated theme that ties them together. Look for
the connecting thread between seemingly different ideas.
```

---

## Generate Variations

```
Read the draft at content/03-drafts/[FILENAME].md and create
2 alternative versions with different:
- Opening hooks
- Tones (more personal, more professional, more provocative)
- Lengths (shorter punchy version, longer story version)
```
