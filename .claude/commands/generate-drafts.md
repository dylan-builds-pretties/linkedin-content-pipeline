Read the theme file at content/02-themes/$ARGUMENTS (add .json if not provided).

Create 2-3 LinkedIn post draft files in content/03-drafts/ following these guidelines:
- Under 1300 characters (LinkedIn limit for full display)
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Strong hook that stops the scroll
- End with a question or call to action
- Conversational, not corporate
- Include line breaks for readability

Name files: YYYY-MM-DD-topic-v1.json, v2.json, etc.
Use the existing draft format (see content/03-drafts/_example.json).
